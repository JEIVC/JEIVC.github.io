        <p class="disabled">Ouch. Well, that's twenty-two. Judging by the volume, you'd guess it was only about 5 metres from the shed, which is a worrying statistic. It's not long until you'll have to pry off the bar, before someone else kicks it in. Jegus, how do they make these balloons so loud? Explosive chemicals? No, that would be an environmental hazard. Beyond a reasonable doubt, it's the high pressure in those things. That's… unnerving, considering you've now realised how flimsy your balloon is. Its mustard, clear albedo looks shiny, shiny as that of a bubble - it must be delicate like one, too.</p>

        <p class="disabled">And that's twenty-three. Much further away this time, which is good. Anyways, you should probably do something about your really fucking brittle implement. Legs jittering, you stand up and reach to the end of your balloon, being very, very, careful not to accidentally pop it. You grip the two sides of the rubber tip, and ready yourself.</p>

        <p class="disabled">TWENTY-FOUR, twenty-four, okay, okay, okay. You freeze your hands just enough so your rattling doesn't lead to you letting essentially all of the air in the balloon out. Once you've gathered yourself up again, you part your hands by a few millimetres, and a grating, but quiet hiss emanates from the bottom. Once the diameter of the thing shrinks by a centimetre or two, you let go of it, and it rises slowly back up, bouncing back down when it stretches its ribbon fully. You breathe a long sigh of relief.</p>

        <p class="disabled">Unofficially, five sixths of the competition is out. Hold on, you've survived much longer than expected. And you mean to tell me that NO ONE's bothered to check the shed?</p>

        <p class="disabled">You're… pretty lucky, then.<br>…<br>Hmm, what's there to do here? Your eyes scatter across the divots and markings dotted around the walls of the shed. They ease back towards the door, after a while. You check if it's moving.</p>
